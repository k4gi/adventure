So, yes, I'm making a roguelike. I've just gotta, if I'm learning NCurses, right?

Initial commit pulled out of ncurses-mess :)

Don't resize the terminal after you start the program. Just don't do it.

Build code with `make adven` or `make bravo` or `make charlie` depending on which thingamabob you want.
